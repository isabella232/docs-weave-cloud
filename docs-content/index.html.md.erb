</p>

Weave Cloud for PCF allows Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) users to [visualize,
troubleshoot, explore](https://www.weave.works/docs/cloud/latest/concepts/explore-and-troubleshoot/),
and [monitor](https://www.weave.works/docs/cloud/latest/concepts/prometheus-monitoring/) apps and microservices as they run in Cloud Foundry.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

[Weave Cloud](https://www.weave.works) is a one-click ops platform for development teams that integrates the operational
expertise to deploy, explore, and monitor apps and services running in a cluster.
In the PCF platform you can use Weave Cloud to visualize all your services in a graphical
context-sensitive map and also use it to monitor and troubleshoot your application, and send you alerts if needed.


## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

Weave Cloud for PCF includes the following key features:

* **PCF monitoring**: Collects metrics from all components of PCF.
* **IaaS-level monitoring**: Collects metrics about CPU, memory usage, IO, network, and VM states, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
* **Third-party services monitoring**: Collects metrics from MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ.
* **Application monitoring**: Gathers standard metrics (CPU, memory, or disk usage), arbitrary metrics (gauges, counters, timings, sets), and HTTP-specific metrics (requests per second, status codes, error rates, and more).
* **SSO and multi-tenancy**: Uses the Cloud Foundry UAA service to control access to apps and
resources based on user roles and rights within the platform. Multi-tenancy is implemented according to Cloud Foundry UAA roles. Dedicated shares of the solution are deployed to different spaces to collect metrics from the apps and services running within.
* **Alerts**: Can be defined for each dashboard panel. Alerts allow users to get immediate notifications through email, Slack, and other notification channels.

## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

Weave Cloud for PCF has the following requirements:

* [Pivotal Application Service (PAS)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime) v2.0.x
* [Ops Manager](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager) v2.0.x  

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

The overall solution should be considered **beta quality**.

The Weave Cloud for PCF tile, as well as the Scope Plugins for BOSH and Garden are considered beta-quality software and as such have some limitations:

* The offline buildpack for collecting JMX metrics is unavailable. Only the [online version of the buildpack](https://github.com/Altoros/java-buildpack#jmx-agent-integration) can be used to collect JMX metrics from Java apps.
* Users are limited to using internal MariaDB to store internal Heartbeat data such as user sessions, mappings, dashboards, UI configs, etc.
* Downscaling with retained high availability is only possible for at least two back-end instances.

The Weave Cloud agents (the Scope Probe, and the Prometheus instance configured to push metrics to Weave Cloud) and Weave Cloud itself are production-ready.

Please try it out on your development and test environments and send us your feedback.
